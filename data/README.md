## ðŸ“¦ Iranian Crypto Exchanges Arbitrage Data

This dataset contains historical orderbook records (ask and bid prices) collected from six major Iranian cryptocurrency exchanges: Wallex, Nobitex, Ompfinex, Raastin, Ramzinex, and Exir. Data was gathered every 5 seconds by a custom script running on a server for two weeks, resulting in over 800,000 records.

The final database is in SQLite format (about 3 GB uncompressed, 81 MB zipped) and is provided here for research and backtesting purposes.

The data can be used for:
- Arbitrage opportunity analysis
- Market trend and liquidity studies
- Backtesting trading strategies on real historical data
